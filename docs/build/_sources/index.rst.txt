PyGRO: a Python integrator for General Relativistic Orbits
=================================

PyGRO [pronounced /'pi.gro/, from the italian **pigro**: *lazy*] is a Python library that provides a series of tools to perform the numerical integration of the geodesic equations describing a particle or photon orbit in any metric theory of gravity, given an analytic expression of the metric tensor.

This documentation comes with a series of tutorial that will the guide you through the different possibilities that PyGRO offers
